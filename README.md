# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis

In this challenge a DataFrame of ride-sharing is sorted by city type. 
Using Pandas and Matplotlib, multiple-line graph is created showing the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

Based on the analysis, it can be noted that the average fares are higher in rural areas, however, since there were a fewer rides, the overall fare was much lower compared to urban and suburban areas. The pivot table and the line graph both indicate low profit in rural cities.

## Summary 
Based on the analysis we can concolude that the rural areas do not provide much profit. 
If there are more drivers in the rural areas, profit may increase, however the income per-driver will decrease. 
The consumers would benefit from this as it would decrease the price as a result of the competition. If focus is placed
in the urbran areas, the income would increase for larger cities. There are both pros and cons.
